:::tip[Regression:]
Learning a continuous function from a set of known data points
:::

This site is a hands-on course covering linear regression, which is one of the simplest forms of machine learning and foundational to much of the rest of machine learning. We will cover simple cases, look at vectorising regression, using design matrices, and finish with bayesian models.

We will also touch on some broader machine learning ideas like cross-validation.

We start out with a jupyter notebook; you can download a zip file with everything you need from [here](/api/workbooks/1).
