In start-up terms, a 'strategy' is the answer to the question 'how do we grow?'.
Start-ups must grow to a sustainable scale (e.g. to cover fixed costs), so growth is core to their business.

growth concerns three main areas;
1. finding product market fit
2. growing within market
3. identifying new adjacent markets


## The user Journey

Core to the growth model is the user journey, which can be visualised as so:

users are acquired, and then activated into a habit. We then try to retain these users so we can monetize them. We also establish compounding growth mechanism (e.g. direct referral) so that our userbase can grow more quickly.

habits: whenever I want to do x, I go to y.
Our use of a product is habitual when we have a 'go to' solution.


## Compounding growth
Compounding growth happens when the growth rate of the userbase is proportional to the number of users.

Compounding growth is caused by two things: CGMs and Network effects. They can operate individually or together; when they operate together, they are mutually reinforcing.


## Types of CGM

CGMs can be either direct or indirect; a direct CGM is where users directly refer new users
an indirect CGM uses some other kind of currency; for example, content. Users produce this content which in turn attracts more users. in some cases a CGM may have a currency=money.

### Why not Linear Marketing?
Linear marketing used to be the main way of doing things and is still used by many companies.

the cost of linear marketing has increased and its effectiveness has decreased. This can be explained by the idea of saturation - other companies move into the same space and the crowding reduces the overall effectiveness.

Secondly, our understanding of CGMs has become more advanced and as a result they are even more effective. When they work right, they are 'free', and they cause much faster growth.


Some amount of linear marketing is required to get the CGM started. It is like the principal investment, and the compounding growth is like the interest.
