# Basics
We need to model the growth of our business. A model needs 3 components:
1. linear acquisition -> acquiring users from marketing
2. compounding growth -> referral mechanisms
3. churn -> users stop using the product.

Depending on the ratios of these sources of user growth, different growth curves arise:

Or, something like this can happen:

Here, we have good compounding growth, but poor retention - so all our users leave :(

## What is growth engineering:

Techniques for systematically introducing a new product idea into a large-scale market and driving it to market.

Lean start up concepts:
1. fail fast -> apply boyds law. Figure out if your product works quicky so you can achieve PMF quicker
2. pivot-or-persevere -> build into your business evaluations of how well you are performing; ask weather you should pivot (try something new) or persevere (keep doing what we are doing). The idea is to regularly reivew this and make decisions often -> thereby making decisions fast.
3. innovation accounting / learning metrics -> find metrics that we can measure that indicate how well we are doing. DO NOT FALL FOR THE McNamara Fallacy.
4. find PMF -> tailor the product to the market; Or, change markets to better suit your product. Key idea: Identify a group who want something, and sell that thing.


Learning metrics vs Vanity Metrics:
learning metrics accurately measure how well we are doing.
Vanity metrics sound good, but don't really represent the truth of what is going on with the business.  Example:
Total users (vanity) vs Monthly active users (Learning)

it always better to retain users than to spend money acquiring new ones!!!




## model pre-eminence not functional pre-eminence
we should organise our business around the idea of the growth model;
this means we do not segment into sales, engineering, etc. 

Instead we segment our business as it makes sense according to the model; perhaps on product features or on retention, acquisition, etc.


Be mindful of Conway's law -> organisation structure is copied into the product.


Avoid metric soup: we need a manageable number of effective metrics.

# Growth Model
A growth model has three components:
1. linear marketing
2. user journey
3. compounding growth
linear marketing brings in the first customers
We optimise the user journey so that we acquire, activate and retain as many users as possible. This is finding PMF.
Finally, We create compounding growth mechanism so that our growth can acclerate and bring us to scale quickly.

The growth model is part of our strategy. It helps us:
1. find PMF
2. grow in our market
3. identify new adjacencies for expansion.
