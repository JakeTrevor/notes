certain products consist of a network of participants. In such networks, the more participants there are, the more valuable the network is to those participants. This is an attractive force to bring in new participants to the network, reinforcing the effect.
In fact, the effect generally growth much stronger for bigger networks, which is illustrated by metcalfe's law:

>[!tip] Metcalfe's Law
> $$\text{value} = (\text{\# participants})^2$$


For this reason, Network effects are the second source of exponential compounding growth.

Network effects are not the same as CGMs 
CGMs:
- are often accelerated by nfx
- can accelerate nfx
- but exist independently


# Sides
networks often have multiple sides; some do not - for example, facebook is a 1 sided network; there is only one kidn of user, which is attractive to all other users.

In contrast, some networks are multi-sided. A common type is a 2-sided netwokr with producers and suppliers; think uber.
producers attract suppliers, and suppliers attract producers, but typically not the other way around.

often with these networks there is a 'hard-side' - one side of the network provides most of the value.



# Scale based network effects
Some network effects become availible only when the network grows to sufficient size. there are broadly three kidns: 
- brand-power
	- product becomes so large that it becomes a household name; thus it gains trustworthy ness and more powerful acquisition
- data-power
	- as the product grows, it gains more data about its usage, which in turn can be used to optimise it and increase the value of the network
- purchasing power
	- when a company gets big enough, it can make big purchases and secure discounts


## Downsides:
networks are built on trust. so when turst is lost in a company, this significantly damages the value of the network.

conversely, increasing trust can strengthen a network.
airbnb has a ratings system, and amazon will often reinburse a customer if they receive a faulty product, independently of the seller.


Network Liquidity:
To scale smoothly, a network must have sufficient supply and demand, which are in balance.

If suppliers join a network to find too few buyers, they will leave quickly. The same is true of buyers. This is particularly problematic for new networks, and a strategy to overcome it is required. Often this involves subsidising one side of the network; for example, uber subsidises drivers in new cities to increase supply.

proper Liquidity is still important in later phases of a products lifecycle; uber uses surge pricing to manage this, attracting more drivers and discouraging additional riders, keeping them in balance.


## Bootstrapping

its hard to attract users when the network is empty (much like with content). there are a few strategies to overcome this:
- focus on the hard side
- build small dense networks

sometimes one side of the network provides much more value than the other (i.e. uber drivers; harder to acquire and provide the most important part of the product). In this case, its important to focus efforts on that side of the network.

The second thing to realise is that a small, dense and well connected network is more valuable than a sparse, poorly connected one. Think Facebook: valuable if your friends are on it, but not really otherwise. This is what doomed google+, which failed to generate dense networks and deliver value.

You can build dense networks by focusing on specific groups. Facebook grew by targeting individual colleges - natural dense networks. These then attracted other colleges, and caused growth.
## diminishing returns
with some networks, the value added by additional users begins to taper off with scale. To understand this, think about adding one more restaurant to a delivery app with no other restaurants on it, vs one with 1000 restaurant on it. The value added is clearly greater in the first case than the second; thus networks can experience diminishing returns.

## anti-network effects
Sometimes networks can create negative effects as well as positive ones, where growth creates a less valuable product. Think about the proliferation of trolling - possible only in larger communities where anonymity is possible. These negative effects are known as anti network effects.

A related phenomena is hard-side rebellion, where the more valuable side start to rebel against the network as it grows. examples include Ubers drivers or vines' creators.


anti-network effects often arise through enshittification - which is where a product is made less valuable when its owners seek greater profits. Enshittification generally follows the following pattern:

1. run service at a loss until users are locked in
2. abuse users to support suppliers, until they are locked in
3. abuse both for Maximum Money(TM)
