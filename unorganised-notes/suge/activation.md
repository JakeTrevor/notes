Activation is the part of the user journey where we try to get the user to use our product habitually.
Habits happen at a natural frequency. this is why it is difficult for products with a low natural frequency to to activate users - users are likely to stop using the product long before the habit has formed.

The activation phase is responsible for the large initial drop in users in our cohort retention graph; we want this to drop to be smaller, so we need to improve our activation.

Activation is comprised of two key steps:
1. deliver initial value (onboarding)
2. continue to deliver value
## Onboarding

A critical part of activation is onboarding - getting a user fully onto the platform. before we can deliver initial value, we need to collect some minimal amount of information. for example, we cannot find flights if we do not know where you want to travel.

there is a balance to be struck - we need to deliver value to keep the user interested, but we also need to collect information to deliver value.

to that end, its useful to think about the activation inequality:
$$
\text{Value Perceived} > \text{Effort Required}
$$
This isn't a precise quantitative measure; instead, its a statement of our aim. We can visualise this with a cognitive energy chart. Each step in onboarding either adds or removes energy; we need to make sure it never goes to zero.

We can improve our activation performance by trying to increase the users energy during activation, or by reducing the energy required to perform  a step. 

useful ideas include;
- reordering the onboarding flow to keep energy up
- indicate progress
- positive messages 
- cross-out exercise (remove unnecessary details/words)
- long distance page view exercise
- don't mandate email verification until later.

These techniques need to be tested; sometimes they will work, but sometimes they will hinder performance.

We then need ot continue delivering value to the user in a way that helps them form a habit. We can do this with techniques like
- push notifications
- emails
- product prompts (temporary and permanent)
- eliminating dead ends
