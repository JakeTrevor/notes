When selecting which channels to use for acquisition, we need to think about how the chanel fits with the rest of the system. In particular, we need to consider model-chanel fit, product chanel fit and chanel-market fit. 

business Model-channel fit concerns weather the business model can support acquisition through that channel. We can understand this by thinking about the LTV:CAC ratio. The LTV of a user is determined externally to the channel; by the business model. Therefore, we need to consider weather the cost of the channel is justified when compared to the value the new user will bring. It does not make sense for instagram to send send sales reps out to recruit users; however for a phamacuiticals company this makes more sense. This is due to different LTVs for the two business modelsl.

We also need to consider channel-model fit. The product is intended to serve a particular market. It is important therefore that the channel we select allows us to reach that particular market. It would not work if we tried to reach teenagers with radio adverts, for example.

Finally, we should consider porduct-channel fit. Does the product integrate well with th echanel? this consideration might take into account weather the channel fits the image of the product (e.g. it does not make sense to market luxury watches on a bargain website).

Initially the CPA starts high; this is representative of the fact that business has not yet found PMF perhaps, or soem alternative kind of fit. However they adapt and within about 4 months they do ahceive this, reuslting in the low CPA costs for the channel. This in turn causes other companies to want to explot this channel, which results in more business coming to the channel. This sowly saturates the channel, making acquisitions rarer and more costly. This explaisn the latter half of the data, which shows a steady increase to the CPA.

The LVT:CAC starts quite low; this can be explained in two ways. Firstly, the company may not have an accurate estimate for the life time value of users on the product. Secondly, they may not have developed effective retention techniques. 
As these elements improve, the LTV increases, which increases the LTV:CAC ratio. The decreasing CPA cost is likely also contributing to this increase. At around 15 months in, the company has clearly developed good retention and monetisation techniques, as they reach a peak LTV:CAC. However, from this point the increased CPA starts to dominate, and the LTV:CAC begins to decline again.

Cac for 1:
225 + 9,200/138 = 292
cac for 2:
180 + 11,300/89 = 307

average CAC: 
$300

LTV:CAC should be 3:1; therefore LTV = 3* 300 = 900

Assuming a average retention time of 6 months = 0.5 years;
ARUP = 900 /0.5 = 1,800

ensuring successful onboarding requires a user to finish the onboarding process with some amount of mental energy remaining. Some activities are more 'annoying' - and therefore mentally draining - than others. Therefore it is wise to split up such activities so that users have time to regain some energy. We can do this by presenting the user with some amount of value - perhaps with a small preview of the product. Doing this
