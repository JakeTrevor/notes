Retention: keeping an existing user on the product

retention is important because it impacts:
- the lifetime (& therefore lifetime value) of the user
- referral rates of a user

Its always cheaper to retain an existing user than to acquire a new one. So retention is critical for the health of any business.


## Churn

A product cannot keep acquiring new users forever; the total addressable market for our product is always limited. Therefore, acquisitions will eventually plateau at some maximum value. This is called ***Saturation***.

It's very unlikely that all our users will keep using the product forever (Espeically if we do nothing about it!). Users who leave the product are called churned users. We measure this loss with the churn rate.

> Churn rate: The percentage of users lost over a given time period

Even a small churn rate (e.g. 1%) can have a big effect; it reduces the maximum number of users we might have at once, and eventually, it will come to dominate; we will begin to lose users.

Larger churn rates are disastrous. Even 5% has a very big (and bad) impact on our total number of users.

Churn impacts the effectiveness of compounding growth mechanisms and the total revenue we can earn from customers.

No matter how sophisticated your marketing and acquisition strategies might be, churn will always come to dominate - so we need to do our best to keep it low.

## Retention
typically, we need to be able to track retention in real time; thus looking at the churn rate after the fact is not enough. Instead, we track cohorts; groups of users that all joined around the same time.


A cohort retention graph usually has a sharp drop-off at the start; this is normal, and happens because many of our acquired users will not be activated. What happens after this drop off is the retention performance of our product. In an ideal case, we would want the graph to be flat; to not churn any users. A small downwards slop is more normal, and not totally disastrous. A sharp downward slope (i.e. losing a lot of users) is very bad, and poses an existential threat to the business unless it is addressed.


Plotting cohort retention charts is a good way to assess the health of the business, and they are a core tool.


## Retention Factors

we can improve retention by increasing engagement intensity;
engagement intensity is 
a) how often a user engages with the product and 
b) how intense that engagement is (i.e. how long you use it for)

different kinds of products have different engagement intensities. this is because they have different **natural frequencies** of usage. You might book a flight a few times a year, whereas you might use social media a few times a day. Thus, they have different natural frequencies.

Products with higher natural frequencies tend to have better retention; users tend to stay with that platform longer. Thus, its useful to be able to increase the natural frequency of the product.

There are two ways to do this:
1. add new features
2. increase usage of existing features

We could try to sell more books, for example, or we could start selling music too. Both of these strategies can be done in tandem.

## Learning effects

some products experience a learning effect, where a user uses the product very intensely for a short period of time, but then, once they have 'learned' whatever it is they wanted from the product, usage tends to drop off. Examples include things like fitness or diet trackers.

## Transaction frequency
There are some products where increasing the natural frequency is very difficult. For example, its quite difficult to get people to buy more flights in a year, because travel is difficult to find time for and expensive to do.

However, we can add other features in, which do not necessarily make us money, which help us keep users engaged with the product; for example, sending out an email news letter. The idea is to keep users engaged so that when they do need to use the product, they remember to use *our product*.

Here we distinguish the *transaction frequency*  - the frequency at which users transact with the product - and the natural frequency - the frequency at which users interact with the product (including interactions that do not directly generate revenue).

This is essentially a retention-awareness mechanism. Indirect content based CGMs often serve as retention awareness mechanisms - the content that users produce help to keep other users retained.


## Interaction length
you can also try to increase the intensity of each individual interaction; an example might be the autoplay features on youtube or other streaming services. These are designed to increase your viewing time, and thus the total time you spend with the product (and thus the engagement intensity).
