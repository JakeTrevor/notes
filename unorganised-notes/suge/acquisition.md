acquistion is about bringing new users onto the product. It isn't concerned with 

acquisition is important because it is how the business grows. If we have no acquisition, we have no growth.

## Channels
we can break up acquisition into channels through which users are brought onto the product. These fall broadly into three categories

1. intent
2. awareness
3. referral

## intent-based channels

intent based channels involve directly targeting users who may want to use our product; two classic examples are SEO and SEM.

*Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)* is about optimising your website's *landing pages* so that it organically places near the top of any search queries for that topic. This involves optimising the content, but also in building up *domain authority*. engines like Google place sites that are considered "Authoritative" closer to the top. This can make it difficult for start ups to break into SEO, as it is not easy to displace existing authoritive.

SEO is best treated as a marketing *and engineering* problem together; businesses will get best results when doing this.

*Search engine marketing (SEM)* is paying for your site to place at the top of related search queries. There are many tools for managing this.

## Awareness-based channels

awareness based channels involve targeting a wide selection of people - even those who do not want to use our product right now. The idea is to make them aware of the product, so that if they ever do need a solution, they might remember us and use our product.

awareness based channels have much worse conversion rates than intent-based channels; however, it also tends to improve the performance of intent-based channels - it can help build trust. Thus, many companies blend both. 
However, the low performance is also why many start-ups choose to ignore it. Other options produce better results. for less cost

Typical examples include TV and radio ads. Another important example is Facebook; Facebooks capabilities far exceed those of other options however. the targeting provided is far more detailed.

## Referral-based Channels
CGMs are a form of user referral, which makes them a special kind of acquisition channel. Key characteristics:
1. can potentially drive exponential compounding growth
2. most have no marginal cost; though there are costs for development and optimisation.


# Acquisition Strategy


The four fits

There are four fits that must be acheived for a product to find success; 

Product-Market fit:
- the product must be wanted and desired by its target market
Model-Market fit:
- can the business make money enough from its market?
- e.g. 
	- charging people $1000 a year for a streaming service -> not going to work
	- selling industrial drainage simulation software to millions of people -> market is not that large
- key questions: how many customers in the market? how much can i make from each one?
- will this allow us to reach e.g. our annual revenue goal?

model-Channel fit:
- can the business cover the costs of acquisition on this channel?
- e.g.
	- hiring sales team to sell whatsapp -> not going to work; LTV:CAC is wrong


product-channel fit (aka. market-channel fit):
- does the channel make sense for the product?
- does the channel make sense for the market?
- e.g.
	- marketing to grannies on the radio -> good
	- marketing to grannies on tiktok -> bad
	- marketing luxury watches on a porn site -> bad
	- marketing luxury watches on TV -> good

## Channel cost
The cost of acquiring a single user on a given channel tends to increase over time. This is because of the chanel life cycle:
1. channel starts being used; initial attempts may not be that successful as company learns
2. channel is optimised and becomes effective
3. success attracts other companies which
	1. add competition and drive up the price
	2. lower the effectiveness of the channel overall.

## Super Aggregators

A small number of products reach super-aggregator status. An aggregator is an internet service which has become regarded as the point of discovery for a particular thing; for example, google is the place to look for websites. Booking.com is the place to look for hotels. In these cases, the products hold so much inventory that it seems pointless to look anywhere else.

Becoming an aggregator is powerful because it becomes a strong acquisition channel with very little need for marketing.


A super-aggregator is an aggregator that has become so dominant  that its strength begins to further accelerate, cementing its dominance. google is a good example; everyone needs to be on google, so they optimise for that. Thus increasing the power of Google's search results, and reinforcing its dominance.

Super-aggregators have a particular effect on acquisition cost. everyone wants to be on Google's front page, so they pay more for being placed there. The increase competition creates a strong spike in the price of the channel. 


This is why CGMs are important: though they are not free, they are usually cheaper than google, especially in the long run.


# quality of Acquisition
The quality of acquisition matters; we want to acquire people who will use our product. If we just acquire people willy-nilly, our activation rates will be very poor. This is Bad(TM)

# Modelling acquisition

User acquisition in a CGM can be thought of as having multiple sub-steps. Each of these steps leaks users. By analysing our performance on these steps, we can see where we should focus our efforts to make the most effective changes and limit the leakage as much as possible.
